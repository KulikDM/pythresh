class AUCP(BaseThresholder):
    r"""AUCP class for Area Under Curve Precentage thresholder.

       Use the area under the curve to evaluate a non-parametric means
       to threshold scores generated by the decision_scores where outliers
       are set to any value beyond where the auc of the kde is less
       than the (mean + abs(mean-median)) percent of the total kde auc.
       See :cite:`ren2018aucp` for details

       thres_ : threshold value that seperates inliers from outliers
       
       Notes
       -----
       
       The area under the curve (AUC) is defined as follows:
       
       .. math::
        
          AUC = \mathrm{lim}_{x\rightarrow\inf} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x) \delta x \mathrm{,}
          
       where :math:`f(x)` is the curve and :math:`\delta x` is the incremental step size
       of the rectangles whose areas will be summed up. The AUCP method generates a 
       curve using the pdf of the normalized decision scores over a range of 0-1. 
       This is done with a kernel density estimation. The incremental size step is 
       :math:`1/2n`, with :math:`n` being the number of points of the decision scores.
       
       The AUC is continuously calculated in steps from the left to right of the data 
       range starting from 0. The stopping limit is set to 
       :math:`\mathrm{lim} = \bar{x} + \lvert \bar{x}-\tilde{x} \rvert`, where :math:`\bar{x}` 
       is the mean decision score, and :math:`\tilde{x}` is the median decision score.
       
       The first AUC that is greater than the total AUC of the pdf multiplied by the 
       :math:`\mathrm{lim}` is set as the threshold between inliers and outliers.
