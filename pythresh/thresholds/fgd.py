class FGD(BaseThresholder):
    """FGD class for Fixed Gradient Descent thresholder.

       Use the fixed gradient descent to evaluate a non-parametric means
       to threshold scores generated by the decision_scores where outliers
       are set to any value beyond where the first derivative of the kde
       with respect to the decision scores passes the mean of the first
       and second inflection points. See :cite:`qi2021fgd` for details.

       Parameters
       ----------

       Attributes
       ----------

       thresh_ : threshold value that separates inliers from outliers

       Notes
       -----

       A probability distribution of the decision scores is generated using
       kernel density estimation. The first derivative of the pdf is
       calculated, and the threshold is set as the middle point between the
       first and second inflection points starting from the left side of the
       data range.

        Parameters
        ----------
        decision : np.array or list of shape (n_samples)
                   which are the decision scores from a
                   outlier detection.

        Returns
        -------
        outlier_labels : numpy array of shape (n_samples,)
            For each observation, tells whether or not
            it should be considered as an outlier according to the
            fitted model. 0 stands for inliers and 1 for outliers.
