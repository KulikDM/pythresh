class MTT(BaseThresholder):
    r"""MTT class for Modified Thompson Tau test thresholder.

       Use the modified Thompson Tau test to evaluate a non-parametric means
       to threshold scores generated by the decision_scores where outliers
       are set to any value beyond the smallest outlier detected by the test.
       See :cite:`rengasamy2020mtt` for details.

       Parameters
       ----------

       alpha : float, optional (default=0.01)
            Confidence level corresponding to the t-Student distribution map to sample

       fallback : str ('ignore', 'warn', 'raise'), optional (default='warn')
            The action to take for thresholders when their criterion are
            not met. In these cases when set to 'ignore' on eval and fit
            all train data is set to inliers and the threshold is set to
            max of the train scores + eps. Passing 'warn' will do the same as
            'ignore' but also produce a warning. If 'raise', the thresholder
            raises a ValueError.

       random_state : int, optional (default=1234)
            Random seed for the random number generators of the thresholders. Can also
            be set to None.

       Attributes
       ----------

       thresh_ : threshold value that separates inliers from outliers

       dscores_ : 1D array of decomposed decision scores

       Notes
       -----

       The Modified Thompson Tau test is a modified univariate t-test that eliminates outliers
       that are more than a number of standard deviations away from the mean. This method is
       done iteratively with the Tau critical value being recalculated after each outlier removal
       until the dataset no longer has data points that fall outside of the criterion. The Tau
       critical value can be obtained by,

       .. math::

           \tau = \frac{t \cdot (n-1)}{\sqrt{n}\sqrt{n-2+t^2}}  \mathrm{,}

       where :math:`n` is the number of data points and :math:`t` is the student t-value
