class ZSCORE(BaseThresholder):
    r"""ZSCORE class for ZSCORE thresholder.

       Use the zscore to evaluate a non-parametric means to threshold
       scores generated by the decision_scores where outliers are set
       to any value beyond a zscore of one.
       See :cite:`bagdonavicius2020zscore` for details.

       Attributes
       ----------

       thres_ : threshold value that seperates inliers from outliers
       
       Notes
       -----
       
       The z-score can be calculated as follows:
       
       .. math::
           
           Z = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{\sigma} \mathrm{,}
           
       where :math:`\bar{x}` and :math:`\sigma` are the mean and the 
       standard deviation of the decsion scores respectively. The threshold
       is set that any value beyond an absolute z-score of 1 is considered
       and outlier.

            it should be considered as an outlier according to the
